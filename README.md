# cssm-test

Minimal example to test `css-loader-minify-class` with `composes`.

- `git clone git@github.com:davemcorwin/cssm-test.git`
- `cd cssm-test`
- `yarn add`
- `yarn build`
- `open dist/index.html`

It just lists the classes, you can see the first one gets minified, but the second does not.
